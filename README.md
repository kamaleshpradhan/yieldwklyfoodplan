# "Problem well defined is problem solved" is what the small program
# below demonstrate.
# The current problem is to prepare a weekly food menu from a bunch of food
# options available for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Any special condition like
# one can have only bread or cereal or any other curb products in breakfast also
# achieved through data declaration without much additional code logic.
# This program also shows an usage of generators.
# This is just for demonstration and may have bugs. Feel free to enhance. Cheers!
